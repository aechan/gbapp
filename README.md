# GBA++üïπÔ∏è

Gameboy Advanced emulator implemented in C++17

First, all the original gameboy's hardware will be emulated since it's a simpler system and then the rest of the gameboy advance's more *advanced* hardware will be built on.

Currently working on the simulated MMU (Memory Management Unit) in order to finish the implementation of all of the z80's instructions.

Will use SDL for cross platform input, audio and to create the OpenGL context.

## Planned phases
1. CPU - in progress
2. Memory - in progress

4. Graphics
5. Integration
6. Input
7. Sprites
8. Interrupts
